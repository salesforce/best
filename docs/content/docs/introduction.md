# Dev Guide

Lightning web components are custom elements built using HTML and modern JavaScript.

The Lightning Web Components UI framework uses core [Web Components](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/) standards and provides only what’s necessary to perform well in browsers. Because it’s built on code that runs natively in browsers, the framework is lightweight and delivers exceptional performance. Most of the code you write is standard JavaScript and HTML.

Build apps anywhere, any way. You can build an app with your favorite tools, like Webpack, TypeScript, and Babel, and run it on Heroku, Google, or anywhere else. You can also package an app to create a desktop experience in Electron.

::: tip
The name of the framework is Lightning Web Components, capitalized. When we refer to the components that you create, we use lowercase, Lightning web components.
