# Running Remotely

Now you that you've written some benchmarks and set up your `best.config.js`, it's time to set up Agents to remotely run your tests in environments that produce consistent results.

## Agents

Agents run performance benchmarks. Deploy them to dedicated hardware with stable environments so the results are consistent.

::: important
While dedicated hardware can be expensive or hard to manage, we **strongly** recommend running Best Agents on dedicated hardware. Dedicated hardware means that there won't be any other processes on the machine influencing your benchmarks. This is key to a reproducible and reliable measurement.

### Provisioning an Agent

To provision a Best Agent, your server needs [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) so Best can run your benchmarks using the headless runner inside Google Chrome.

The easiest way to set up an Agent is to click the button below. It creates a Heroku app with everything you need.

::: note
To use a Best Hub, provision the Hub first and then come back and press the button to configure your Agent to work with your Hub.

If you need more control over deployment, follow [this template](https://github.com/salesforce/best-heroku-deploy/tree/agent). Only minimal tweaking is required to run this in any environment.

If you need complete control, install the `@best/agent` package. You'll probably need the `@best/runner-headless` package to use the headless Chrome runner. Use the above template for inspiration on setting up your Agent.

Once you have these installed, run this command to start the Agent.

```sh
yarn best-agent
```

### Configuring Best to Run Remotely

The last step to run your benchmarks remotely is to add the runner to your `best.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
    projectName: 'agent-running',
    runner: 'remote-agent',
    runners: [
        {
            runner: "@best/runner-remote",
            alias: "remote-agent",
            config: {
                host: "https://agent-url.herokuapp.com",
                remoteRunner: "@best/runner-headless"
            },
        },
    ]
}
```

## Hubs

Use Best Hub if you have a lot of jobs that you want to run or want to run your benchmarks on multiple machines. Best Hub provides a single entry point for your entire organization to access Best Agents.

### Provisioning a Hub

Provisioning a Best Hub is even easier than setting up an Agent. The easiest way to set up a Hub is to click the button below. It creates a Heroku app with everything you need.

[![Deploy Best Hub](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/salesforce/best-heroku-deploy/tree/hub)

If you need more control over deployment, follow [this template](https://github.com/salesforce/best-heroku-deploy/tree/hub). This is a minimal template so you must configure it to suit your target environment.

If you need complete control over the Hub, install the `@best/agent-hub` package. You will probably need the `@best/runner-headless` package. Use the above template for inspiration on setting up your Hub.

Once you have installed these packages, run the following command to start the Hub.

```sh
yarn best-agent-hub
```

If you used the Heroku button, a `TOKEN_SECRET` is automatically set as an environment variable, otherwise you must set it yourself. This token is used by your Agents and clients for authentication.

### Configuring Your Agents

Now that your Hub is set up, you can configure your Agents.

The easiest way is to click the button in the Agents section to deploy to Heroku. It will guide you through provisioning an Agent with the necessary configuration to interact with your Hub.

Alternatively, you can manually configure your Agents to talk to your Hub. Set an environment variable called `HUB_CONFIG` to a JSON string with the following information.

```js
{
    hub: {
        host: "https://hub-url.herokuapp.com",
        authToken: process.env.HUB_TOKEN,
        pingTimeout: 180000, // Optional: Default is 180000ms (3 minutes).
    },
    agentConfig: {
         spec: { // Only benchmarks with this spec can run in this agent.
             browser: "chrome",
             version: "76"
         },
         host: "https://agent-url.herokuapp.com", // Required.
         options: { path: "/best" }, // Connection Options
         remoteRunner: "@best/runner-headless", // Required.
         remoteRunnerConfig: {}, // Required (may be an empty object).
     }
}
```

The Agent uses this configuration to register with the Hub. Additionally, the `spec` field describes the browser and version that this Agent is running. This is used together with the `spec` option inside the `best.config.js` below.

You should set the environment variable `HUB_TOKEN` to your token which you got from the previous steps.

### Configuring Best

Now that you have configured your Hub and Agents, tell Best to run your benchmarks on them. Update your `best.config.js` with the following.

```js
module.exports = {
    projectName: 'hub-running',
    runner: 'hub',
    runners: [
        {
            runner: "@best/runner-hub",
            alias: "hub",
            config: {
                host: "https://hub-url.herokuapp.com",
                options: {
                    query: { token: process.env.HUB_TOKEN }
                },
                spec: {
                    browser: "chrome",
                    version: "76"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This is similar to configuring Best to run on an Agent, except that you have added a `spec` configuration option. Like you added information about the browser and version to the Agents, you can tell the Hub which browser and version to run your benchmarks.

You should set the environment variable `HUB_TOKEN` to the token that you got from the previous steps.

## Agent & Hub Front End

Both the Hubs and Agents come with a built-in front end that allows you to monitor the state of the benchmarks they're running.

To view the front end, visit the URL of your Hub or Agent.
