# GitHub Integration

Best comes with GitHub Integration for rapid adoption into your existing development flow. It uses GitHub's [Checks](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/) to report when benchmark results differ across commits.

## Installation

Best relies on a GitHub app to interact with your repositories. Follow [GitHub's guide to create a GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/). We recommend naming the App `Best - [organization name]`.

The GitHub App requires these permissions:

- **Checks**: Read/Write
- **Issues**: Read/Write
- **Pull Requests**: Read/Write

Set these environment variables so Best can authenticate and interact with your GitHub App. We recommended setting these environment variables in your CI.

```sh
GIT_APP_ID=0000
GIT_APP_CERT_PATH=/path/to/private-key.pem
GIT_APP_CERT_BASE64=base64_encoded_version_of_private_key
```

Set either `GIT_APP_CERT_PATH` or `GIT_APP_CERT_BASE64`.

::: tip
To enable GitHub integration for the front end, set these environment variables on your front end instance as well.
:::

To enable comments on pull requests from your CI workflow, set the environment variable `PULL_REQUEST` with the URL of the pull request.

## Usage

Best activates the GitHub integration when you pass the `--gitIntegration` flag. This flag tells Best to create a GitHub Check and comment if there is a significant performance change.

::: note
You must specify the `--compareStats` flag to use `--gitIntegration` because Best reports meaningful differences _across commits_.
:::

## Configuration

By default, Best comments on a pull request when the average performance across your benchmarks changes by more than `5%`. You can change this threshold by adding the following to your `best.config.js`.

```js
{
    commentThreshold: 5
}
```
