# üèÜ Best Performance Benchmarks üèÜ

[![Build Status][build icon]][build url]

Best allows you to write benchmarks in the same way you write unit
tests. This allows you to integrate Best into your CI workflow to
create a consistent picture of your code's performance over time.

**Reproducible Results**: Best is designed to run on dedicated hardware,
this means that you are running your benchmarks in the same environment
everytime.

**Expressive Metrics**: Best comes packed with ability to measure all
the types of metrics you might want to know.

**GitHub Integration**: If your team uses GitHub then you can easily
create a GitHub App so that you can integrate Best into your Pull
Request workflow.

**The Best Frontend**: Best comes built-in with a frontend dashboard
that allows you to monitor your benchmarks over the time with each commit.
