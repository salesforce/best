[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/best.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/best)

Best allows you to write benchmarks in the same way you write unit tests. This allows you to integrate Best into your CI workflow to create a consistent picture of your code's performance over time.

**Reproducible Results**: Best is designed to run on dedicated hardware, this means that you are running your benchmarks in the same environment everytime.

**Expressive Metrics**: Best comes packed with ability to measure all the types of metrics you might want to know.

**GitHub Integration**: If your team uses GitHub then you can easily create a GitHub App so that you can integrate Best into your Pull Request workflow.

**The Best Frontend**: Best comes built-in with a frontend dashboard that allows you to monitor your benchmarks over the time with each commit.
